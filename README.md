# 🌤️ Weather Predictor

A simple **Weather Prediction Web App** built using **Streamlit** and a **Keras deep learning model**.  
The app predicts the type of weather (Drizzle, Fog, Rain, Snow, or Sun) based on user inputs such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed.  

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive **Streamlit UI**
- Takes user input: precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed
- Predicts weather conditions:
  - 🌧️ Drizzle
  - 🌫️ Fog
  - ☔ Rain
  - ❄️ Snow
  - ☀️ Sun
- Shows model accuracy (**82.60%**)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for the frontend web app)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for the trained ML model)
- **NumPy**
